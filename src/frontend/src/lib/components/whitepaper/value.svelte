    <h1 class="text-xl">$BOOK Utility Token</h1>
    <p>
      OpenBook operates as a DAO (Decentralised Autonomous Organisation). The
      $BOOK token is used within the DAO for the following purposes:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc px-4">
      <li>
        Organisations will pay an annual subscription for the basic OpenBook
        service with $BOOK tokens.
      </li>
      <li>
        Organisations will be able to settle invoices and pay employees in
        $BOOK, along with any other ICRC token.
      </li>
      <li>Neuron holders will be rewarded with $BOOK maturity interest.</li>
      <li>
        Finance professionals will be able to design and build financial reports
        based on the granular chart of accounts structure an organisation sets
        up. These professionals will be rewarded in $BOOK tokens when an
        organisation uses their designed report.
      </li>
      <li>
        As OpenBook grows it will venture into all areas of business management,
        subscriptions to these additional advanced features will also be paid
        using $BOOK.

    <h1 class="text-xl">DAO Valuation</h1>
    <p>
      In forecasting the potential revenue for our platform, we conducted a
      comparative analysis between two established SaaS platforms: Salesforce
      and QuickBooks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Salesforce:</b> A dominant force in the CRM space. Salesforce has seen consistent
      growth over the years. In 2023, their annual revenue was $31.352 billion, up
      18.35% from 2022. To provide a broader perspective, their revenue in 2022 was
      $26.492 billion, marking a 24.66% growth from 2021, which had a revenue of
      $21.252 billion, a 24.3% increase from 2020.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>QuickBooks:</b> Highly popular in the accounting software market. As of
      the recent data, QuickBooks generated a total revenue of $9.6 billion, a 25%
      increase year-over-year. Their combined platform revenue, which includes QuickBooks
      Online, TurboTax Online, and Credit Karma, accounted for $6.6 billion, marking
      a 39% growth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both these platforms represent a combined user base of approximately 6.6
      million. It's crucial to understand that the impressive revenue figures,
      especially from Salesforce, often stem from their enterprise licensing
      agreements. Enterprise licences differ significantly from individual or
      small business licences. They're priced higher, offer an extensive range
      of features, and often include additional services like consulting,
      training, and customisation. This model can significantly inflate the
      average revenue per user, especially for platforms like Salesforce, which
      caters to large corporations and businesses across the globe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drawing insights from QuickBooks and Salesforce, we find that Salesforce's
      revenue is approximately $10,451 per user per year, while QuickBooks
      stands at about $2,667 per user. We'll use the more conservative figure
      from QuickBooks as our benchmark. To hit a valuation of $1 billion over 8
      years, with a projected revenue per user of $2,667, we would require a
      user base of 37,500. This goal entails an average onboarding of roughly
      4,688 users per annum with this target representing a mere 0.57% of the
      combined 6.6 million user base of Salesforce and QuickBooks.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="space-y-4">
    <h1 class="text-xl">Adaptive and User-Focused Revenue Model</h1>

    <p>
      Central to OpenBook's revenue strategy is our dedication to simple,
      user-friendly subscription models. Users have the freedom to activate or
      deactivate platform features as their business needs evolve. This unique
      model allows for a customisable experience, ensuring that users only pay
      for what they need, when they need it. Crucially, even when a feature is
      deactivated, all associated data is preserved, ready to be reactivated at
      any time. This approach not only makes OpenBook adaptive to changing
      business landscapes but also ensures that it remains economically
      efficient for our users. $BOOK tokens will be used to pay for these
      services.
    </p>

    <p>
      In line with our commitment to directly benefit neuron holders, OpenBook
      will allocate 50% of any ICRC-1 token received by the DAO each month to
      neuron holders. Distribution to neuron holders will be proportional to
      each neuron's total $BOOK value and its remaining duration. This ensures a
      fair and equitable redistribution of revenue. Calculation for this
      distribution will be based on the status of BOOK neurons as at the end of
      each month, aligning with the DAO's transparent and community-focused
      ethos. The remaining 50% will remain in the OpenBook treasury free for the
      DAO to use as required.
    </p>

    <p>
      The reinvestment of revenues into the DAO and direct distribution to
      neuron holders are designed to foster a cycle of growth, user engagement,
      and shared prosperity.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="space-y-4">
    <h1 class="text-xl">DAO Reward Structure</h1>

    <p>
      The OpenBook DAO's rewards are funded by the minting of new BOOK tokens,
      minting 2.5% of the total supply annually. The minted $BOOK is distributed
      throughout the year for the following reward categories
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc px-4">
      <li>Professional Service Rewards (75%)</li>
      <li>Governance Rewards (25%)</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 class="text-xl">Professional Service Rewards</h1>

    <p>
      The DAO has the ability to propose and vote on new features or
      adjustments, leveraging the expertise of finance professionals. This
      integration of domain knowledge ensures that the feature development
      process is strategic and thoughtful, providing businesses with a clear
      understanding of the services available. The inclusion of these
      professionals in the DAO's decision-making adds a layer of practical
      insight and relevance to the features and adjustments considered, ensuring
      they align with real-world financial needs and trends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Professional Service Rewards further reinforce this approach. Initially,
      these rewards will be used for writing jurisdiction-specific reports by
      local finance professionals, who will build tailored reports suited to
      their local jurisdictional finance rules and formats. This reward pool
      will later expand to include other experts in fields relevant to future
      OpenBook features, continuing to enrich the platform with practical and
      expert insights.
    </p>

    <h1 class="text-xl">Governance Rewards</h1>

    <p>
      The DAO will reward users for participation in governance with $BOOK
      tokens. Failed proposals will cost 10 $BOOK tokens to a neuron holder
      which will be deposited into the DAOâ€™s treasury.
    </p>
