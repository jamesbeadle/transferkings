    Businesses are increasingly turning to Software as a Service (SaaS)
    platforms to manager their internal processes. Platforms like Salesforce &
    Quickbooks use this common software distribution model in which applications
    are hosted by a third-party provider and made available to customers over
    the internet. This model allows businesses to access software applications
    without the need for internal hardware or technical expertise, paying on a
    subscription basis.

    The Internet Computer blockchain has provided the world with a foundation
    for genuine decentralisation. This technological leap is particularly
    transformative for businesses worldwide, which are increasingly reliant on
    Software as a Service (SaaS) platforms for critical data processing.
  </p>
  <p>
    Businesses today face the task of managing multiple subscriptions across a
    range of platforms. Their use cases often extend further, encompassing
    multiple organisations, currencies, and user roles. These challenges open
    the door for opportunities to create a more streamlined and integrated
    approach to business operations.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the world of SaaS platforms, diversity in functionality often comes at a
    cost. These platforms are frequently cluttered with ads, compromising the
    user experience. Additionally, they are characterised by complex
    subscription models, where access to full features is often gated behind
    various tiers of service. This can lead to a situation where businesses feel
    trapped, using software that doesn't fully meet their needs or forces them
    into paying more for essential features.
  </p>
  <p>
    Moreover, each dataset is privately held, limiting the potential for broader
    societal benefits. These siloed data repositories prevent the collective
    intelligence and insights that could be gleaned from a more open and shared
    approach.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is where a transformative opportunity emerges. Envision harnessing the
    power of these extensive datasets in an accessible, unified way. By applying
    AI to a consolidated data lake, a DAO could democratically decide to develop
    powerful tools.
  </p>
  <p>
    These tools wouldn't just elevate business operations' functionality and
    efficiency; they could also offer broader societal benefits. This vast
    resource of data holds potential far beyond individual organisational
    growth. It represents a communal asset, poised to drive innovation and
    progress in a manner that resonates with the ethos of decentralisation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Furthermore, a critical issue in today's SaaS environment is data ownership.
    Currently, businesses often don't retain full control over their own data.
    This limitation restricts their ability to fully leverage this asset,
    particularly in the creation of bespoke AI models and other innovative
    applications. Changing this paradigm is essential. By shifting towards a
    model where businesses retain ownership of their data, they are empowered to
    explore and implement custom AI solutions and other tools that cater
    specifically to their unique needs and objectives.
